    <h1>Map: History of the Byzantine Empire</h1>
    <p>The Byzantine Empire impressively lasted for over a millennium through to the end of the Middle Ages, from roughly 395 CE to 1453 CE. This timeline project shows the conception of the empire to its very last days, highlighting territorial regions the empire controlled over the course of its lifetime.</p>
    <p><em>Note: The highlighted regions and map markers were mapped by hand using rough estimation from various resources. They are intended to not be 100% accurate but instead to provide a general understanding of locations.</em></p>

    <p><strong>The timeline begins as far back as 667 BCE when Byzantium was first colonized.</strong></p>
