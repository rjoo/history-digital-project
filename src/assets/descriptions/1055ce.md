# 1055 - 1179 CE

From here on, the Byzantine Empire suffered irrevocable defeats. In Southern Italy, Normans (Northern France ethnic group from the region of Normandy) revolted and forced Byzantine out of Italy. To the east in Asia Minor, the Turks grew in power and became unstoppable. The Byzantine's defeat at the Battle of Manzikert was a critical one that saw them eventually lose Syria and most of Asia Minor.

In 1095, the Byzantine emperor requested military aid from the Pope and what resulted was the army of the **First Crusade**. Alongside Byzantine forces they were able to regain parts of the Asia Minor.
