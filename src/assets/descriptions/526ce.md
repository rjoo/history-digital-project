# 526 CE - 565 CE

Justinian was the nephew of Justin I and succeeded him as emperor in 526 CE. His primary focus was restoring the Roman Empire's lost western region into the great empire it once was. His generals were able to swiftly reconquer parts of Africa, Italy and Spain. Justinian is well known for reforming Roman law with Corpus Juris Civilis, a code of laws that is still studied and used in courts today.
