# 330 - 395 CE

Around 330 CE, Emperor Constantine I founded the new capital of the Roman Empire ("The New Rome") where Byzantium stood, soon to be known as **Constantipole**. The new capital was heavily fortified and located in between trade routes and the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Leading up to 395 CE, Christianity was adopted as the official state religion of the Roman Empire.
