# 1422 - 1453 CE

In 1422 CE, the Ottomans attempted their first siege on Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire by this time was large and powerful and their army was significantly larger than the Byzantine's. They didn't succeed in overtaking Constantinople then, only because they retreated to deal with a rebellion by an Ottoman prince in Anatolia (Asia Minor). 

The end of the Byzantine Empire came in 1453 CE after the Ottoman Empire's second attempt. The Ottomans successfully brought down the once impenetrable walls of Constantinople with a siege that lasted for 53 days and the Ottomans greatly outnumbered the Byzantine defenders. Ottomans were significantly helped with Hungarian designed gunpowder cannons.

*Fast forward: The Ottoman Empire immediately made Constantinople the capital of their empire and ruled extensively for several centuries until their collapse in 1923, after which Constantinople was renamed to Istanbul.*
