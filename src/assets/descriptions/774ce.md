# 774 CE - 812 CE

**Charlemagne**, known as Charles the Great, conquered the Frank and Lombard kingdoms in 774 CE. Because of his achievements, in 800 CE he was chosen to be the new "Emperor of the Roman Empire" by the Pope. He then went on to conquer and unite much of Western Europe.

Constantinople did not recognize Charlemagne's title initially (they wanted Italy for themselves), but conceded eventually from military pressure. The Byzantines were able to regain much of the Balkan peninsula territory and had momentarily stabilized the border with the Arabs.

For the first time in 300 years, there was an Eastern and Western Emperor of the Roman Empire again.
