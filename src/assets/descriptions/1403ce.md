# 1347 - 1403 CE

The Byzantine coin began to diminish in value and that severely weakened their ability to defend themselves from the Turks and Bulgarians (among others). This resulted in the Byzantine Empire shrinking to just Constantinople and southern parts of Greece. One particularly powerful group among the Turks were the Ottomans. They captured much of the Balkans and all of Asia Minor.
