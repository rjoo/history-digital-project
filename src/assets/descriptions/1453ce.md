# 1453 CE

The end of the Byzantine Empire came in 1453 CE when the Ottoman Empire successfully brought down the, once impenetrable, walls of Constantinople. The siege lasted for 53 days and the Ottomans greatly outnumbered the Byzantine defenders. The walls were brought down with Hungarian designed gunpowder canons.

*Fast forward: The Ottoman Empire ruled extensively for several centuries until their collapse 1923, when they renamed Constantinople to Istanbul.*
