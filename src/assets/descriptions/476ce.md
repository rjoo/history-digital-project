# 476 CE - 526 CE

Historians agree that 476 CE, when Emperor Augustulus was dethroned by barbaric Germanic tribes (led by an ex Roman general), marked the year the Western Roman Empire fell. The Byzantine emperor at the time, Zeno, did not send help to the west but also did not recognize a new ruler in Rome. *Interestingly, Zeno dealt with problems of his own in the form of rebellions, and was even dethroned for a year.*

In 518 CE, after rising through the military ranks and besting his political rivals, **Justin I**, a peasant born illiterate, became the emperor. His reign was short-lived however as he was nearly 70 years old when he became emperor.
