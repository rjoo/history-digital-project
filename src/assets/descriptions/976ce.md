# 976 - 1014 CE

In 976, Basil II became emperor of the Byzantine Empire and his reign is most notably recognized for the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire's territory and power. To the east, he fought against the Arab Caliphate and was able to push the border into Syria. To the north, he employed strategic ruthlessness to overtake Bulgaria in the Balkans. This feat over the Bulgars gave him the nickname *Bulgar Slayer*.
