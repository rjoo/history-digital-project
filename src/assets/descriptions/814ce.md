# 814 - 925 CE

After Charlemagne's death, the Western Empire started to crumble (not so dissimilarly to Justinian's efforts of reunification several centuries back).

Byzantine Empire faced two major conflicts over this period of time. One, with the Bulgars taking rule over much of the Balkans. The other with Muslims in the seas.
