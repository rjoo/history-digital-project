# 395 - 476 CE

After the death of Emperor Theodosius in 395 CE, the Roman Empire was peacefully split into two, the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. Theodosius imparted rule to both of his sons.

Both empires dealt with conflicts from outside forces over this period of time. In the west, Visogoths (Germanic tribe) repeatedly assaulted Rome and even successfully sacked the city in 410 CE. In the east, the Huns led by Attila, were bribed with huge annual sums to keep them at bay until Attila's death in 453 CE.

After hearing of the attack on Rome, the Byzantine emperor set out to improve Constantinople's defences by building <a href="https://ancient.eu/img/r/p/750x750/7740.png?v=1569518395" data-credit="Ancient.eu - https://www.ancient.eu/image/7740/cross-section-of-the-theodosian-walls/" data-image>massive three-lined fortifications</a>.
