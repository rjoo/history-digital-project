# 1181 - 1288 CE

The Byzantine Empire continued to weaken as the northern territories were lost to the Hungarians. The Crusaders, amassed for the Fourth Crusade intended for Egypt and Jerusalem, were excommunicated by the Pope and allied with the Byzantine prince Alexios IV. The prince wanted to be put on the throne and promised wealth to the Crusaders, but he was unable to fulfill that promise. The Crusaders then sacked the city of Constantinople leaving the empire in a crippled state.

What resulted was a fractured empire divided into individual states. One of the states, Nicaea, reconquered Constantinople in 1261 CE and brought about a temporary reunification.
